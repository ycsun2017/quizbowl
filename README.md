This is a question-answering system implemented by **AmazingDH team**, CMSC723, University of Maryland.
The trained model can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BieK5p-ir-XP8QSqz2_LS5bJq59xkm-s?usp=sharing. Then just put these files into /src directory!

We also have **another system** available in https://github.com/LiuzcEECS/qanta-codalab
